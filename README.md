# Charlie-s-Discord-Bot
This is a discord bot I'm working on

I've built this bot and am running it in an Ubuntu 20.04 environment
I've included a sample TOKEN.env file that does not have my server details but could be edited with the necessary information to work in another discord server with its own account. 

Current functionality
have created several commands that will cause the bot to respond to input in the server
  - !addquote - adds a quote to a sqlite database
  - !hello - responds with "Hello!"
  - !inspireme - queries the sqlite database for a quote and inputs it into the channel. 
  - !time - displays the current date and time. 
 
This application runs on the python 3.9 interepreter.
