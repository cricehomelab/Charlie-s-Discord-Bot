# Charlie-s-Discord-Bot
This is a discord bot I'm working on

Current functionality
have created several commands that will cause the bot to respond to input in the server
  - !addquote - adds a quote to a sqlite database
  - !hello - responds with "Hello!"
  - !inspireme - queries the sqlite database for a quote and inputs it into the channel. 
  - !time - displays the current date and time.
